# DISC REU: Project 1

## Introduction
This is an on going research area in the McLachlan Lab at the University of Notre Dame. The goal of this project is to implement a similar methodology implemented by Meghan Vahsen (a graduate student in the lab who classified Tamarisk in the Colorado River Basin) to monitor population abundance of species of sedge and grass in the Chesapeake.

## Classifying sedge and grass plots using satellite image processing
This is a directory for all of the R code and Landsat/drone images processed to classify sedge and grass plots in the Chesapeake Bay.
