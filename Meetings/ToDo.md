### 1. Introduction:

The introduction will cover the background in general. This includes discussing the Chesapeake, pollution in the area, and efforts to cleanup since acknowledgment. Next, it will include a discussion about the importance of marshes/wetlands in the bay as well as the role that grasses play in a wetland. After that, remote sensing will be talked about. Specifically, the satellite data will be explained, the satellite project we used will be shared, and also, a reference to remote sensing uses from other research will be shown. Finally, classification and, more precisely, the random forest algorithm will be shared along with past papers that have implemented similar methods using remote sensing for ecological studies.

### 2. Methodology:

**2.1 Study Site** This subsection will contain background information into SERC's research marshland as well as why the site is of interest to SERC and the McLachlan lab. It should have some graphic of the site.

**2.2 Grass Species Data** - explains how this data was collected and its format

**2.3 Spectral Data** - mentions covariates (in table format), talks about Landsat 8 details

**2.4 Model** - explains setup, model used, sampling plots, model use for future

### 3. Results:

**3.1 Model Results** - visuals, accuracy (in table format), hand-scored results??

**3.2 2016 Predictions**

### 4. Discussion:


### 5. Future Work:
